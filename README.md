# My Terminal Configs :]

This is a "backup" of my [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/) settings JSON file. This contains an example and some notes below on the README.

## FAQ

#### Where would `ms-appdata:///roaming` be located?

The general location of Windows Terminal (if installed via the Windows Store) would be:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\`

I found it before I knew what chatgpt was so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


#### Where do you find the "schemes"?

[Here :}](https://windowsterminalthemes.dev/)


### What is "commandline" used for?
This is where you would place the "execution" call; in most cases if only one distro is installed: `"wsl"` works fine
